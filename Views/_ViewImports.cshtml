    The _ViewImports.cshtml file provides a mechanism to include the directives globally for Razor Pages so that we don’t have to add them individually in each and every page. The _ViewImports.cshtml file supports the following directives:

    @addTagHelper
    @tagHelperPrefix
    @removeTagHelper
    @namespace
    @inject
    @model
    @using

    The @addTagHelper, @tagHelperPrefix, and @removeTagHelper directives are basically used to manage of Tag Helpers. The @namespace directive is basically used to specify the namespace that the ViewImports belongs to. With the help of @inject directive, it supports Dependency injection. The @model directive is basically used to specify the Model for your view. The @using directive basically used to include the common namespaces globally so that you don’t have to include the namespaces in each and every view page.
